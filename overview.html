                <h2>Naming the box!</h2>

                <p>When coming up with a brand name I felt it was important to incorporate the location, Belfast and also to incorporate a sense of discovery and exploration in the name. The issue I found was that the name Belfast doesn't work that well when paired with another phrase e.g. ScoutBelfast, ScoutBelfast.<br /></p>
                
                <p>I eventually decided that it was a better idea to break down my VR idea to it's bare components, what is it about? 360 Degree VR in Belfast. I decided the go with the name °360Belfast as it's simple, straightforward and from my research it doesn't currently exist.</p>

                <div class="align"><h4>Key Question:</h4><h3>Customers, end users, or buyers</h3></div>

                <p>The main question I wanted to solve here is who uses and who wants to use virtual reality. I think this answer is important because it will allow me to develop my vr app to target specific groups.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    
<li>Adults 35+: The main target demographic would be adults as they would generally be the largest percentage who could afford to travel to/around Belfast and thus would use the app to learn about the location.</li>

<li>Young Adults 20 - 30:</li> 
                    
                </ul>
            
                  
                <div class="align"><h4>Key Question:</h4><h3>Features and functions</h3></div>

                <p>The target audience ties into the features and functions of the app, what would someone using the app want or expect to be included? As the overall project is difficult one I think it's best to include what the must have features are and if there is time a list of quality of life features:</p>
                
<ul class="list1">
    
<h5>Key Features:</h5>
